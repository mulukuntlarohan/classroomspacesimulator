# Class room solar virtual simualtor

## Project Description
The Virtual Classroom Simulator is a web-based 3D learning tool developed to teach space concepts through immersive interaction. Built using Unity with C# and WebGL, it allows users to explore models of celestial objects such as Earth, the Moon, black holes, and the solar system. The project enables students to rotate, scale, and move these objects while listening to audio explanations, enhancing both understanding and engagement.

üéØ Objectives
Develop an interactive 3D virtual classroom for astronomy education.

Implement object manipulation (rotate, scale, move) for real-time learning.

Integrate audio explanations for each space object.

Deploy the application on the web using Unity WebGL.

üõ†Ô∏è Design & Implementation
Designed the environment using Unity Asset Store packages with custom lighting and physics adjustments.

Integrated first-person controls (AIO asset) for free movement.

Attached audio descriptions to each 3D model using Unity‚Äôs AudioSource component.

Developed C# scripts for object manipulation features.

Built a user interface with functional buttons (Play, Settings, Quit) and implemented them via Unity UI scripting.

Exported the entire simulation as a WebGL application runnable via a web server.
